# StormViewer
100 Days of Swift (Project 1) In this project, I produced an application that lets users scroll through a list of images and select one to view. 
I familiarized myself with view controllers, storyboards, and the FileManager class. In addition, I built a detail screen and loaded images with UIImage. 

I completed the following (part 3) challenges:
-Use Interface Builder to select the text label inside your table view cell and adjust its font size to 
something larger – experiment and see what looks good. 
-In your main table view, show the image names in sorted order, so “nssl0033.jpg” comes before 
“nssl0034.jpg”. 
-Rather than show image names in the detail title bar, show “Picture X of Y”, where Y is the total number of images and X is the selected 
picture’s position in the array. Make sure you count from 1 rather than 0.

And the following (project 3) challenges:
-Try adding the image name to the list of items that are shared. The activityItems parameter is an array, so you can add strings and other things freely. Note: Facebook won’t let you share text, but most other share options will.
-Go back to project 1 and add a bar button item to the main view controller that recommends the app to other people.
